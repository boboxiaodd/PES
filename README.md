# Palette_Encryption
Palette principle, encryption and decryption

# Principle

```
Red + green = blue
Red + blue = red purple
Blue - green = red
```

With this principle, red represents the content to be encrypted, other colors represent the password, and the encryption is implemented
When the password is green will get red, when the password is other colors get the uncertainty of the color, thus achieving the decryption

# Features
Do not determine whether the password is correct, can achieve the decryption process. (Password not saved)
Decryption is correct in general only human judgment, this will increase the difficulty of cracking
